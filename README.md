# extract-region-from-geotiff-using-shape-file
This code is developed to extract a specific region from a geotiff file using a shapefile and save cropped file to the geotiff file.
First, this code reprojects the .shp file to match the crs of the geotiff file. And then will clip the region from the geotiff file and save it to another geotiff file.
